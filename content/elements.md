## [Get Higher](https://get-higher.herokuapp.com/login)

This project used a Google Job Search API to deliver the job posting feature to the user based on location and career option. Once the user takes our carefully designed personality/aptitude test the user will be recommended a career option that will fit their personality.A key feature of our project is the login portion for the user to keep their progress, information and job interests saved for their next visit which is stored into our very own user information database.

The job search api, Google Map, individualized quiz, calendar for reminders and dashboard facilitate the job seeking experience for the user to stay in our site alone instead of navigating through various job sites/applications which creates the “all in one place” feel that will highlight our site over other sites.
