For the past 5 years, I have served as a dedicated teacher, fostering a positive learning environment and providing students with engaging educational experiences. While teaching has been immensely rewarding, I have come to realize that my true passion lies in the realm of web development. The combination of creativity, problem-solving, and the ability to make a tangible impact on users' experiences has captivated me and propelled me to transition into a career in web development.

During my teaching tenure, I undertook numerous web-related projects to enhance the classroom experience and facilitate student engagement. I have designed and maintained websites for my classes, integrating multimedia elements, interactive tools, and learning resources to optimize the learning process. These experiences have exposed me to various web technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and content management systems such as WordPress.

To solidify my technical skills, I embarked on a rigorous self-study journey, leveraging online resources, the Northwestern coding bootcamp, and collaborating with industry professionals. Through these endeavors, I have developed a strong foundation in front-end development, responsive design principles, and user experience considerations. Additionally, my ability to quickly adapt to new technologies and learn independently positions me as a strong candidate for this role.What sets me apart is my unique combination of teaching expertise, web development skills, and strong communication abilities.
